 * I2C interface
 * Optional filtering
 * Optional snubber network
 * maximum power - 6kW
 * zero crossing detection
 * firmware supprots linear output power control
 * phase shift dimmer mode
 * switch at zero-crossing mode
 * “low level” zero-crossing signal output
 * “low level” triac trigger signal input
 * 4 spare MCU pins available for additional features
 * open source hardware and firmware
